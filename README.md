# The "Closed-source Code" (CSCL) License

The "Closed-source Code" or "CSCL" license is a boilerplate license to use in your proprietary projects, just like you use the open-source alternatives like GPL or MIT.

## Motivation

I always struggled to find a proprietary license template on the internet to put on my private and personal projects that I didn't want to share with anyone. So I've made this up and share it here with everyone to use it in their projects.

## The 3 "W"

### Who can use it?

Everyone, companies included. No limitation or liability whatsoever from me.

### Where to use it?

In your private and personal or professional project. You just need to own the rights of this project and you are ok.

### Where to place it?

Put the license file (normally as LICENCE) with the content below filled with your content at the root folder of the project.
